# Different versions
All samples are available by using different build flags. These are predefined as separate environments in platformio.ini

Use the following commands to program the different samples:

Bleep Drum : `pio run -e bleep -t upload`
Dam Drum : `pio run -e dam -t upload`
Dam Drum v2 : `pio run -e dam2 -t upload`
Dam Drum v3 : `pio run -e dam3 -t upload`

These commands must be run from the BLEEP_DRUM folder

# SignificantÂ changes

I used a two channel 12 bit DAC (MCP4822) instead of the one channel DAC used on the original. This is just because I had it in stock at the time of the build. In order to use the single channel version, use the build flag `MONO`
